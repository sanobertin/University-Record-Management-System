# University Records Management System

This project was developed thanks to COEN243 final class project. <br />
[COEN 243 - Programming Methodology I ](https://www.concordia.ca/academics/undergraduate/calendar/current/section-71-gina-cody-school-of-engineering-and-computer-science/section-71-60-engineering-course-descriptions.html#1379)is an introductory programming class mainly for students in Electrical and Computer Engineering students at Concordia, and it is taught in C++
<br />
The project was designed in a group of two students, namely myself(Bertin Mihigo Sano) and Kruti Patel. 
<br /><br />
**Project Objectives:**<br />
The objective of this problem was to create a fully functioning system that handles the records of students and staff at Concordia University. Based on the following narrative, you need to come up with an Object-Oriented design to represent the different entities in the system.

**Tools/Technologies used:**<br />
- IDE: CLion 2023.x.x
- C++20 
- Cmake 3.27.x for project build
- Developed on macOS
- Git

<br />
To test this code or review this code, you need an IDE and a C++ compiler.
<br />

## Project setup

2. Open the project in your editor.
3. If you need to build with Cmake, ensure you have cmake installed on your system. See [documentation](https://cmake.org/documentation/)

## Building the project

The project uses CMake as its build system.

1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Run `cmake .` in terminal or command prompt to generate build files. These files will be written to **./cmake-build-debug** folder.
3. Run `make` to build the project.

## Running the project

After building the project, you can run the project. `./SchoolSystem`
